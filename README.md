# FizzBuzz Week 5 Assignment 3

## Scenario and Requirements

Tonight you will refactor [last night's homework](https://github.com/SEA-Design-Dev/fizzbuzz-redux__W5-A2).

You must extract FizzBuzz in to its own file (so you now have two separate files), then load both files in the HTML, and from the second (non-FizzBuzz file) invoke the FizzBuzz object and create the output for your DOM. Additionally, your writing method should take a DOM node where the output is to be written.

Additionally your constructor function should accept arguments that let you change the strings of "fizz" and "buzz" (e.g. `new FizzBuzz('bleep', 'blorp')`).
